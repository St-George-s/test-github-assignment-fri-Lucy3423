‘Blog Builder’ is a website which helps you to build your own blog! Each blog features three topics, which each have an individual home page. The user is able to view posts belonging to a specific topic, in addition to adding new ones too!


My aim

My aim for this project was to develop a better understanding of flexbox and generally html and CSS. In my last project, I really struggled with creating layouts and using flexbox. For this reason, I made a greater effort to master these skill with this project. I started by watching some YouTube videos on flexbox, later applying this to very simple blocks on a page.


My inspiration

On Slack, I saw how a lot of people were making personal portfolios, and I thought it would be fun to make an app which helped you to make your own portfolio/blog.


How I planned the project

I started by brainstorming features I wanted to implement into the website, later thinking about what kind of layout I would create for each page. I developed and programmed each page individually, starting from the home screen.


Highlights and challenges

My favourite part of the project was designing the home screen because I enjoyed making it customizable and add different hover effects. At the same time though, this was a pretty hard part of the project because my original design, featuring a fav singer section, did not work out. Therefore, I had to return to the drawing board to think about a different feature which could replace the singer section. I decided to add an astrological star sign section which would display the user’s sign and their birthday. 
I really enjoyed creating the design for the website and having a consistent colour palette throughout. Before beginning the design, I went on Word to pick out different colours I liked the look of – this was a lot of fun!
My problem solving skills really improved throughout this project, because admittedly, I made a lot of mistakes. Whenever I created a new page or tried something new, the program would crash, and it kept saying ‘index out of range’. Eventually though, I learned how to fix these errors and overcome them.
